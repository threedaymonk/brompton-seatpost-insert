# Brompton seatpost height insert

This works in the same way as the seatpost saddle height insert supplied with
newer Bromptons.

Adjust `height` to the amount by which you want to reduce the saddle from its
maximum height.

I suggest trying a print with an increased value of `slack`: it's a little bit
tight at 0.1mm.

I printed this in PLA at 0.175mm layer height. You will need a support for the
clip on the tab.
